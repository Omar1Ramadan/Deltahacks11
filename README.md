# Loan Ranger: Your Ally for Fair and Inclusive Lending

## Inspiration
Access to capital can make or break someone’s financial future. Yet, systemic biases often shut out Black communities across the Americas and Africa, leading to fewer approvals, higher interest rates, and lost opportunities. We wanted to change that—so we created **Loan Ranger**, riding in to ensure that anyone seeking capital has the fair shot they deserve.

## What It Does
**Loan Ranger** is a web application that:

1. **Calculates an inclusive credit score**  
   We incorporate both traditional data (credit reports, etc.) and *alternative data* (assets, credit type diversity, etc.) to better represent a borrower’s creditworthiness. We curated a credit score formula that prioritizes quantitative values such as payment history, credit utilization ratio, length of credit history, credit mix, and more. Each individual should be approved for a loan based on these variables, which are represented by weights determined by their financial history.

2. **Identifies and mitigates bias**  
   Our fairness checks spot potential discrimination in loan approvals or interest rates before final decisions are made.

3. **Offers specialized lending programs** for underrepresented groups  
   From first-time homebuyer discounts to minority-owned business boosts, Loan Ranger automatically applies relevant benefits. Our curated AI chatbot prioritizes getting users the best rate possible, every single time.

4. **Provides explainable decisions**  
   Users see exactly how their loan offer was calculated, removing the guesswork from a traditionally opaque process. They can truly sell the idea behind their loan application and receive unbiased guidance from Loan Ranger.

## How We Built It
- **Front End**: A React-based UI for sign-ups, loan applications, and real-time chatbot interactions.  
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js + Express** for business logic and API endpoints  
  - **MongoDB** to store user data, assets, demographics, and loan profiles  
  - **Cohere’s API** powers the conversational chatbot, providing confidence ratings and negotiation insights  
- **Loan Programs**: A rule-based engine checks eligibility for programs like **First-Time Homebuyer Boost** or **Minority-Owned Business** benefits, adjusting rates or amounts as needed.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- **Sensitive Demographic Data**  
  We had to ensure user consent and secure data handling (race, income, etc.) to maintain privacy and trust.

## Accomplishments That We’re Proud Of
- **User-Centric Chatbot**  
  Loan Ranger’s AI chat interface allows applicants to explain their situation, influencing the final loan offer. It has your back, making sure you receive as much financial assistance as it can give.
- **Tailored Loan Programs**  
  By codifying targeted policies (e.g., low-income assistance, minority-owned business boosts), our platform opens doors that might otherwise remain shut. _You are not aLOAN._

## What We Learned
- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Working with Cohere’s API taught us the importance of clarity when handling sensitive topics like loan eligibility.  
- **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**  
  We refreshed our knowledge of fair lending regulations to keep Loan Ranger compliant and equitable.  
- **Human-Centered Design**  
  Being transparent about loan decisions helps users make informed financial choices.

## What’s Next
1. **Deeper Data Integrations**  
   Connect with real-time credit bureaus and alternative data for more accurate underwriting.  
2. **Mobile-First or USSD Version**  
   Many underbanked populations rely on mobile—so we plan to expand Loan Ranger with SMS/USSD capabilities.  
3. **Partnerships with Lenders**  
   We aim to collaborate with community banks, microfinance institutions, and fintechs that value inclusive, bias-aware lending practices.
